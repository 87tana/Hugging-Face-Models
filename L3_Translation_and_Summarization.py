# # Lesson 3: Translation and Summarization

# - In the classroom, the libraries are already installed for you.
# - If you would like to run this code on your own machine, you can install the following:
# 
# ```
#     !pip install transformers 
#     !pip install torch
# ```

# - Here is some code that suppresses warning messages.
